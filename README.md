# Caesar-Cipher
## Caesar Cipher – Python
A clean, interactive Caesar Cipher encryption program built in Python to demonstrate core programming and logical problem-solving skills.
This project focuses on clear logic, user interaction, and correct handling of edge cases such as alphabet wrap-around and space preservation.


What This Project Demonstrates:
Strong understanding of Python fundamental
Logical handling of encryption algorithms
Use of loops, functions, and conditionals
Clean control flow with a menu-driven interface
Attention to edge cases (spaces, alphabet overflow)


How It Works (Brief):
User selects an option from a menu
Enters a message and a shift value
Each letter is shifted forward in the alphabet
Alphabet wrap-around is handled correctly (Z → A)
Spaces are preserved for readability
Program runs continuously until exit


Example:

Input:
HELLO WORLD
Shift: 3

Output
KHOOR ZRUOG


Tech Stack:
Language: Python
Concepts: Lists, indexing, loops, functions, string manipulation

Notes:
Designed for learning and demonstration, not real-world security
Handles uppercase alphabetic characters and spaces
Simple, readable logic prioritised over libraries


Why This Project:
This project was built to strengthen problem-solving skills and demonstrate how a classical algorithm can be implemented cleanly using basic Python constructs — suitable as an entry-level portfolio project.
