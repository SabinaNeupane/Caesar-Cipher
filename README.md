# Caesar Cipher – Python
A clean, interactive Caesar Cipher encryption program built in Python to demonstrate core programming and logical problem-solving skills.
This project focuses on clear logic, user interaction, and correct handling of edge cases such as alphabet wrap-around and space preservation.


## What This Project Demonstrates
1. Strong understanding of Python fundamentals
2. Logical handling of encryption algorithms
3. Use of loops, functions, and conditionals
4. Clean control flow with a menu-driven interface
5. Attention to edge cases (spaces, alphabet overflow)


## How It Works (Brief)
1. User selects an option from a menu
2. Enters a message and a shift value
3. Each letter is shifted forward in the alphabet
4. Alphabet wrap-around is handled correctly (Z → A)
5. Spaces are preserved for readability
6. Program runs continuously until exit


## Example
Input:  \n
HELLO WORLD     \n
Shift: 3    \n

Output:   \n
KHOOR ZRUOG


## Tech Stack
Language: Python   \n
Concepts: Lists, indexing, loops, functions, string manipulation


## Notes
1. Designed for learning and demonstration, not real-world security
2. Handles uppercase alphabetic characters and spaces
3. Simple, readable logic prioritised over libraries


## Why This Project
This project was built to strengthen problem-solving skills and demonstrate how a classical algorithm can be implemented cleanly using basic Python constructs — suitable as an entry-level portfolio project.
